currently stuck on Task 1, Step 4: Deploying the React App via AWS Amplify. The deployed URL domain page can't displayed (HTTP Error 404). No webpage was found at the address linked from the AWS console. 

Can't push code changes to github. "Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists."

After going to repo setings, creating a public SSH key by entering the command 'ssh-keygen -t ecdsa' it stll didn't work. Tried creating a public rsa ssh key instead, still didn't work. Going to take a break.
