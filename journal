currently stuck on Task 1, Step 4: Deploying the React App via AWS Amplify. The deployed URL domain page can't displayed (HTTP Error 404). No webpage was found at the address linked from the AWS console. 

Can't push code changes to github. "Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists."

After going to repo setings, creating a public SSH key by entering the command 'ssh-keygen -t ecdsa' it stll didn't work. Tried creating a public rsa ssh key instead, still didn't work. Going to take a break.

3.20.2025
getting "Bad configuration. 3 bad configuration options. fatal: Could not read from remote repository." error messages on my .ssh/config files 

3.21.2025
ran nano ~/.ssh/config, changed my ssh config file to 
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myrsa
    IdentitiesOnly yes

added my ssh agent & key:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

now it says it rejected to push some refs. I'm happy to get new errors! and now my ssh key shows that it's in use in my github settings.
